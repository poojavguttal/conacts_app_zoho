# conacts_app_zoho
# steps for running the contacts app
I have used php and xammp server as backend and html5 and css for frontend

I have attached the file called contacts app_zoho it is a main code file and sql file

First start the xammp server and then place the contacts app_zoho file in htdocs folder of xammp

import the sql file in xammp server 

Then on browser type localhost/contacts app_zoho

Now you can see the 3 files

open the signup page and register yourself and then signin and now you can save your contacts.
